This folder contains my implementation and practice problems related to Stack in Data Structures using C++. I have implemented basic stack operations like push, pop, peek, and display, along with practice programs 
to understand stack applications.

## Topics covered:
* Stack implementation using arrays
* Stack using linked list
* Push, Pop, Peek operations
* Basic stack-based problems

This is part of my DSA learning journey for BCA and interview preparation.
