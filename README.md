This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice codes written in C++ as part of my BCA learning journey. The goal of this repo is to build strong fundamentals and prepare for
interview-level questions step by step.

## What’s Inside

📌 Basic to intermediate DSA concepts
📌 Clean and understandable C++ implementations
📌 Practice problems with logic-focused solutions
📌 Topics aligned with college syllabus + interviews

🧠 Topics Covered (growing list)

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Recursion
* Searching & Sorting
* STL basics (vector, map, etc.)
(More topics will be added as I progress.)

🛠 Language & Tools

Language: C++
IDE: VS Code
Compiler: GCC

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Strengthen DSA fundamentals
* Practice writing correct and efficient code
* Track my progress as a BCA student
* Build confidence for technical interviews

📌 Note

This repository is for learning and practice purposes. Code may improve and evolve as my understanding grows.
